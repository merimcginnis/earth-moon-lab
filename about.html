<!-- I used ChatGPT to generate my captions here is the prompt: I am making a website about earth and the moon. i want the copy to be witty and funny. make a short description from the perspective of the earth and one from the perspective of the moon describing how one is better than the other. make them have a personality based off of real facts but dont make it too hard to read.-->

      <p>Yeah, Earth thinks it's the star of the show, but let’s be honest, I’m the one with the best views. Without me, Earth would just be... well, spinning aimlessly in space. I’ve got the tidal power (check out those oceans moving with my every whim), and let’s not forget, I'm the main character in some epic night skies. Sure, Earth’s got trees and stuff, but who needs 'em when you've got the perfect rock garden like me? I may not have life, but I’ve got mystery. And, let’s face it – you’d be pretty lost without me. You’re welcome. But hey, Earth, if you’re so great, why do you have so many problems with climate change? Maybe you should spend a little more time thinking and less time spinning in circles.</p>
